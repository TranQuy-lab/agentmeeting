# GitHub Security Bug Bounty

Software security researchers are increasingly engaging with internet companies to hunt down vulnerabilities. Our bounty program gives a tip of the hat to these researchers and provides rewards of $10,000 or more for critical vulnerabilities.


You can find more information in our [rules](https://bounty.github.com/#rules), [scope](https://bounty.github.com/#scope), [targets](https://bounty.github.com/#targets), and [FAQ](https://bounty.github.com/#faqs) sections. 

Happy hacking!

## Rules

### Before you start

* Check the [list of domains](https://bounty.github.com#scope) that are in scope for the Bug Bounty program and the [list of targets](https://bounty.github.com#targets) for useful information for getting started.
* Check the list of bugs that have been [classified as ineligible](https://bounty.github.com/ineligible.html). Submissions which are ineligible will likely be closed as `Not Applicable`.
* Check the [GitHub Changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/) for recently launched features.
* Never attempt non-technical attacks such as social engineering, phishing, or physical attacks against our employees, users, or infrastructure.
* When in doubt, contact us at `bounty@github.com`.
* By participating in GitHub's Bug Bounty program (the "Program"), you acknowledge that you have read and agree to GitHub's [Terms of Service](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service) as well as the following:

  * you are not currently a GitHub employee or contractor, were not a GitHub employee or contractor within six months prior to submission, and you did not collaborate on your submission with anyone who was.

  * your participation in the Program will not violate any law applicable to you, or disrupt or compromise any data that is not your own.

  * you are solely responsible for any applicable taxes, withholding or otherwise, arising from or relating to your participation in the Program, including from any bounty payments.

  * GitHub reserves the right to terminate or discontinue the Program at its discretion.

  * Only test for vulnerabilities on sites you know to be operated by GitHub and are [in-scope](https://bounty.github.com#scope). Some sites hosted on subdomains of `GitHub.com` are operated by third parties and should not be tested.

  * We cannot reward any individual on any U.S. sanctions list, or any individual residing in any U.S.-sanctioned country or region. For more information, please see https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines.


### Legal safe harbor

Your research is covered by the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program Legal Safe Harbor](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/security-policies/github-bug-bounty-program-legal-safe-harbor) policy. In summary:
* We consider security research and vulnerability disclosure activities conducted consistent with this policy as “authorized” conduct under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the DMCA, and other applicable computer use laws such as Cal. Penal Code 502(c). We waive any potential DMCA claim against you for circumventing the technological measures we have used to protect the applications in this bug bounty program's scope.
* We want you to coordinate disclosure through our bug bounty program, and don't want researchers put in fear of legal consequences because of their good faith attempts to comply with our bug bounty policy. We cannot bind any third party, so do not assume this protection extends to any third party. If in doubt, ask us before engaging in any specific action you think might go outside the bounds of our policy.
* Because both identifying and non-identifying information can put a researcher at risk, we limit what we share with third parties. We may provide non-identifying substantive information from your report to an affected third party, but only after notifying you and receiving a commitment that the third party will not pursue legal action against you. We will only share identifying information (name, email address, phone number, etc.) with a third party if you give your written permission.
* If your security research as part of the bug bounty program violates certain restrictions in our site policies, the safe harbor terms permit a limited exemption.


### Performing your research

* Do not impact other users with your testing, this includes testing vulnerabilities in repositories or organizations you do not own. If you are attempting to find an authorization bypass, you must use accounts you own.
* We recommend adding your HackerOne `@wearehackerone.com` email address to any GitHub account that you use to perform security research and testing. If you use multiple GitHub accounts for testing, [you can use aliases of your HackerOne email address](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-email-alias.html#multiple-aliases). Clearly identifying accounts that are associated with bounty research helps our teams to differentiate between possibly malicious activity and that of researchers involved in our Bug Bounty program. Please note that adding your HackerOne email address does not provide any exemptions to our Terms of Service or permit you to act beyond our bounty rules and scope.
* The following are **never** allowed and are ineligible for reward. We may suspend your GitHub account and ban your IP address for:

  * Performing distributed denial of service (DDoS) or other volumetric attacks
  * Spamming content
  * Large-scale vulnerability scanners, scrapers, or automated tools which produce excessive amounts of traffic.
    * Note: We _do_ allow the use of automated tools so long as they do not produce excessive amounts of traffic. For example, running one `nmap` scan against one host is allowed, but sending 65,000 requests in two minutes using Burp Suite Intruder is excessive.
* Researching denial-of-service attacks is allowed and eligible for rewards only if you follow these rules:

  * There are no limits for researching denial of service vulnerabilities against your own instance of [GitHub Enterprise Server](https://bounty.github.com/targets/github-enterprise-server.html). We strongly recommend/prefer this method for researching denial of service issues.
  * If you choose to test on GitHub proper (i.e. `https://github.com`)
    * Research **must** be performed in organizations or repositories you own
    * Stop **immediately** if you believe you have affected the availability of our services. Don't worry about demonstrating the full impact of your vulnerability, GitHub's security team will be able to determine the impact.


### Handling personally identifiable information (PII)

* Personally identifying information (PII) includes:
  * legal and/or full names
  * names or usernames combined with other identifiers like phone numbers or email addresses
  * health or financial information (including insurance information, social security numbers, etc.)
  * information about political or religious affiliations
  * information about race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or other identifying information that could be used for discriminatory purposes
* Do not intentionally access others' PII. If you suspect a service provides access to PII, limit queries to your own personal information.
* Report the vulnerability *immediately* and do not attempt to access any other data. The GitHub Security team will assess the scope and impact of the PII exposure.
* Limit the amount of data returned from services. For SQL injection, for example, limit the number of rows returned
* You must delete all your local, stored, or cached copies of data containing PII as soon as possible. We may ask you to sign a certificate of deletion and confidentiality agreement regarding the exact information you accessed. This agreement will not affect your bounty reward.
* We may ask you for the usernames and IP addresses used during your testing to assess the impact of the vulnerability


### Reporting your vulnerability

* Submissions must include written instructions for reproducing the vulnerability. Submissions without clear reproduction steps or which only include reproduction steps in video form may be ineligible for a reward.
* When reporting vulnerabilities you must keep all information on HackerOne. Do not post information to video-sharing or pastebin sites. Videos and images can be uploaded directly via HackerOne.
* For vulnerabilities involving personally identifiable information, please explain the kind of PII you believe is exposed and limit the amount of PII data included in your submissions. For textual information and screenshots, please only include redacted data in your submission.
* During the course of an investigation, it may take time to resolve the issue you have reported. We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing details regarding an issue you’ve reported until the fix has been publicly made available.


### Receiving your award

* All reward amounts are determined by our [severity guidelines](https://bounty.github.com/#rewards).
* In addition to the bounty reward, some reports will also receive a coupon code that can be redeemed for swag items at [the GitHub Bug Bounty Merch Shop](https://bugbounty.printengine.com/). For more information about the store, [please visit the shop's FAQ page](https://bugbounty.printengine.com/faqs).
* When duplicates occur, we only award the first report that was received (provided that it can be fully reproduced).
* You are free to publish write-ups about your vulnerability, and GitHub will not limit what you write. We may pay out your reward before the vulnerability is patched, so we may ask that you delay publishing to keep other GitHub users safe.
* GitHub is a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for GitHub Enterprise Server. Eligible Bug Bounty submissions that affect GitHub Enterprise Server may be assigned CVEs. These CVEs will be shared with submitters via HackerOne and listed in the GitHub Enterprise Server [release notes](https://enterprise.github.com/releases).
* If you would prefer to donate your bounty reward to an established 501(c)(3) charitable organization, GitHub will match your donation. If the bounty has already been processed into your account, it can no longer be donated through HackerOne and is no longer eligible for matching donations. To reduce the likelihood of a bounty being processed before it can be donated, we recommend [changing your payment preferences to monthly in your account settings](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/payout-methods.html). To donate your reward and have it matched, submit a support ticket to HackerOne with the following information: 
  * the report ID for which you want to donate the bounty;
  * the name and website of the charity you want to donate to;
  * that you would like the donation matched using GitHub's process; and 
  * whether you want to be named as the donor or would prefer to remain anonymous. Keep in mind that we can only attribute the donation to you if the charity allows us to give a name.
